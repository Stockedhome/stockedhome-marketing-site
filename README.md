# Stockedhome In Detail

## Do You [Dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)?
Hell yeah I do! This application was developed with my own personal use in mind. Observing the frustration of myself, my family, and the general public is plenty enough to motivate building such an application.

## Where Our Funding Comes From
Stockedhome is a free and fauxpen-source project. For the SaaS version, funding is provided through our partnered retailers' affiliate programs. If you opt to self-host instead, we wish you the best of luck and promise to always provide you with a fully-featured, free, and fauxpen-source version of Stockedhome. The self-hosted version should never be any different than the cloud-hosted version outside of the initial setup.

## Fauxpen-Source?
Stockedhome is a fauxpen-source project. We believe in the power of open-source software and the community that surrounds it ([and I've released a fair bit of truly-open-source software](https://github.com/BellCubeDev)), however we recognize the risk of the application's code being used for commercial purposed by less-than-benevolent entities; that is, large, freeloading corporations. As such, Stockedhome is licensed under a license which prohibits the commercial use of the software. This does not comply with the commonly-accepted definition of open-source software, but we believe it is the best way to protect the project while still providing the benefits of open-source software to consumers.

Unfortunately, pure anarchy leaves little room for beneficial orchestration as those orchestrating beneficially will eventually be choked by those who orchestrate malevolently.

### What License Terms Don't Comply With "Open Source"?
The only terms that do not comply with the Open Source Initiative's definition of open-source software are those that prohibit the commercial use of the software. Outside of that, the software is fully open-source and free to self-host, modify, and redistribute.

### Why Is This Alright?
Stockedhome is an end-user application. It is not a library, framework, or other tool that developers would use to build their own applications. As such, the restrictions on commercial use only serve to hamper large, freeloading corporations rather than startups who can't afford to rent our tech. We encourage users to host their own instances of Stockedhome. The only caveat is that you cannot charge for access to the software.

### What If I Want To Use Stockedhome Commercially?
Don't.

### What License Is Stockedhome Under?
